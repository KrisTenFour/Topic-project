                    <h3>Why Dragon Age?</h3>
                    <h2>World-building: Thedas</h2>
                    <p>The Dragon Age games introduce an
                        immersive
                        world that is both complex and easy to understand. Your character's quest is clear and you find
                        a
                        rich
                        history in each pocket of the world of Thedas. You make your own choices, your character
                        has a
                        backstory, you can interact with your companions... all against the backdrop of a richly created
                        world and a strong storyline.
                    </p>
                    <p>After completing the first game (Dragon Age Origins, DAO) I
                        found myself thinking about the world of Thedas soon after.
                        Much like a good book, the world and its characters have stuck with me.</p>

                            <p>The first of the games, Dragon Age: Origins (DAO) was released in 2009.</p>
                            <h4>What I like about it</h4>
                            <p>In my opinion, DAO is by far the most immersive of the games. It is the first (and sadly,
                                only) one to have detailed origin stories. Dialogue choice is extremely well thought out
                                and Companion interaction is consistent. The main quest is epic in every way and it's
                                easy to lose yourself in the story. </p>

                            <h4>What I like about it</h4>
                            <p>The story is great and the introduction of new Companions is always exciting. Although
                                it's on
                                a smaller scale than DAO, it's an easy game to play and it stays engaging throughout.

                            <h4>What I like about it</h4>
                            <p>I have to admit that I lost the plot with DAI. In opposition to DA2, there was almost
                                <em>too</em> much content. Your character is thrown into the midst of social, political,
                                and environmental turmoil and you are left to deal with it. Retrospectively, I should
                                have
                                sat down beforehand to digest what was going on before I dove into the game.

                        Hi, my name is Kristen. I've been gaming since I was a child and love the Dragon Age games.
                        My favorite of the series is Dragon Age Origins (DAO), the first game. It's heavily
                        story-driven and the story outcome is decision-based; all the perfect components for an
                        amazing RPG game.
