                    <h3>Why Dragon Age?</h3>
                    <h2>World-building: Thedas</h2>
                    <p>The unique selling point of the Dragon Age games is its ability to create an
                        immersive
                        world that is both complex and easy to understand. Your character's quest is clear and you find
                        a
                        rich
                        history in each pocket of the world of Thedas. You make your own choices, your character
                        has a
                        backstory, you can interact with your companions... all against the backdrop of a richly created
                        world and a strong storyline.
                    </p>
                    <p>After completing the first game (Dragon Age Origins, DAO) I
                        found myself thinking about the world of Thedas soon after, outside of gaming.
                        Much like a good book, the world and its characters have stuck with me.</p>

                    <li>
                        Hi, my name is Kristen. I've been gaming since I was a child and love the Dragon Age games.
                        My favorite of the series is Dragon Age Origins (DAO), the first game. It's heavily
                        story-driven and the story outcome is decision-based; all the perfect components for an
                        amazing RPG game.
